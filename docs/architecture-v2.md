# Project Chimera - Architectural Design Summary v2.0
**Date**: July 23, 2025  
**Status**: Post-Working Session Design Finalization

## Executive Summary

Project Chimera has evolved from a proof-of-concept multi-agent workflow into a sophisticated, production-ready AI operating system for creative and development tasks. This document captures the architectural decisions and conceptual shifts that transform Chimera from a simple pipeline into an intelligent, interactive, and fault-tolerant agentic platform.

## 1. Architectural Philosophy Shift

### From Monolithic to Modular
**Before**: Single sprawling TypeScript file mixing prompts, state machines, and I/O logic
**After**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules for each agent and capability

### From Pipeline to Operating System
**Before**: Linear fire-and-forget workflow (Master → Architect → Implementer → Critic)
**After**: Interactive, supervised execution with real-time feedback loops and fault tolerance

### From Token-Heavy to Context-Aware
**Before**: Every agent received full context, leading to prompt pollution and excessive token usage
**After**: Need-to-Know principle with intelligent context routing per agent

## 2. Component Naming Convention & Identity

The system adopts a technical, memorable naming scheme that reflects each component's specialized role:

| Layer | Legacy Name | New Identity | Core Function |
|-------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Application** | Chimera CLI/UI | **Chimera System** | User-facing application layer |
| **Orchestrator** | Orchestrator | **KERNEL** | Central supervisor & fault manager |
| **Strategic Planner** | Master/Architect | **SYNTH** | Synthesizes strategic plans from requirements |
| **Code Executor** | Implementer | **DRIVE** | Executes individual plan steps with tools |
| **Quality Auditor** | Critic | **AUDIT** | Reviews output against quality standards |

**Mnemonic Flow**: `KERNEL → SYNTH → DRIVE → AUDIT`

## 3. The KERNEL Evolution: From Coordinator to Intelligent Supervisor

### 3.1 AI-as-Consultant Model
The KERNEL's first interaction is no longer simple clarification but sophisticated consultation:
- **Proactive questioning**: Asks clarifying questions about scope, constraints, preferences
- **Experience-based suggestions**: Proposes variations and improvements based on domain knowledge
- **Collaborative refinement**: Co-authors requirements with the user before execution begins
- **Context building**: Gathers sufficient detail to enable expert-level execution

### 3.2 Live Supervision Model
The workflow becomes interactive and responsive:
- **Real-time streaming**: Provides live progress updates during DRIVE execution
- **Conversational control**: Supports pause/resume/amend commands during execution
- **Dynamic adaptation**: Allows course correction without restarting the entire process
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Maintains user agency while leveraging AI capabilities

### 3.3 Fault-Tolerant Management
The KERNEL becomes responsible for system health and resilience:
- **Timeout protection**: Wraps all agent calls with configurable timeouts
- **Error handling**: Gracefully manages network failures, API limits, and agent errors
- **Re-planning intelligence**: Upon AUDIT failure, provides targeted feedback to SYNTH for corrective planning
- **State management**: Maintains workflow state across failures and retries

## 4. Embedded Expertise Architecture

### 4.1 The Expert Agent Paradigm
Rather than requiring users to have domain expertise, the system embeds knowledge directly into agents:

**SYNTH as Master Craftsman**:
- Encoded with software engineering best practices
- Automatically includes error handling, testing, and documentation steps
- Applies architectural patterns and coding standards
- Considers scalability and maintainability from the start

**AUDIT as Expert Inspector**:
- Contains a "quality constitution" of standards to check
- Validates security practices, performance considerations, and code style
- Ensures completeness of documentation and testing
- Applies domain-specific quality gates

### 4.2 Knowledge Distribution Strategy
- **SYNTH prompt**: Encodes project management and technical architecture expertise
- **DRIVE prompt**: Contains tool usage patterns and execution best practices  
- **AUDIT prompt**: Embeds quality assurance and review methodologies
- **KERNEL prompt**: Provides consultation and supervision capabilities

## 5. Context Management: The Need-to-Know Principle

### 5.1 Intelligent Information Brokering
The KERNEL acts as a context firewall, providing each agent with precisely what it needs:

- **SYNTH context**: User story + constraints + architectural guidelines
- **DRIVE context**: Single PlanStep + relevant tool documentation + execution context
- **AUDIT context**: Complete plan + step artifacts + quality standards
- **KERNEL context**: Full user interaction history + system state + error context

### 5.2 Benefits of Context Isolation
- **Reduced token usage**: Each agent operates with minimal necessary context
- **Improved focus**: Agents aren't distracted by irrelevant information
- **Better performance**: Smaller prompts lead to faster, more accurate responses
- **Cleaner debugging**: Agent behavior is more predictable and traceable

## 6. Technical Implementation Strategy

### 6.1 Module Architecture

│   ├── kernel.ts          # Central supervisor
│   ├── synth.ts           # Strategic planner
│   ├── drive.ts           # Code executor

    └── context.ts         # Context type definitions
```

### 6.2 Communication Patterns
- **KERNEL ↔ User**: WebSocket for real-time interaction
- **KERNEL ↔ Agents**: Async message passing with timeout protection
- **Agents ↔ Tools**: Direct invocation with result streaming
- **System ↔ UI**: Event-driven updates with progress indicators

## 7. Quality Assurance Integration

### 7.1 Built-in Quality Gates
- **SYNTH validation**: Plans must include testing, documentation, and error handling
- **DRIVE monitoring**: Execution steps are validated before and after tool calls
- **AUDIT enforcement**: Multi-dimensional quality checks (security, performance, style, completeness)
- **KERNEL oversight**: Overall workflow quality and user satisfaction tracking

### 7.2 Continuous Improvement Loop
- **AUDIT feedback**: Specific, actionable feedback for re-planning
- **SYNTH learning**: Pattern recognition for common plan improvements
- **DRIVE optimization**: Tool usage efficiency and error reduction
- **KERNEL evolution**: User interaction patterns and satisfaction metrics

## 8. User Experience Transformation

### 8.1 From Command-Line to Conversation
- **Before**: Single prompt input, wait for complete output
- **After**: Interactive dialogue with progress visibility and control

### 8.2 From Technical to Consultative
- **Before**: User needs deep technical knowledge to get good results
- **After**: System acts as expert consultant, guiding user to optimal outcomes

### 8.3 From Brittle to Resilient
- **Before**: Any failure required complete restart
- **After**: Graceful error handling with targeted recovery
